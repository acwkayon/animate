Animate
=======

Animations can add considerable insight into the data we are
exploring. In this [MLHub](https://mlhub.ai) package we illustrate
animations created form our data.

The sports animation is based on Victor Yu's example code posted to
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/VictorYuEpi/status/1061012677907091457)
with the code shared also on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/VictorYuEpi/status/1061681783920619521).
The data comes from the
[IAAF](https://www.iaaf.org/results/olympic-games/2016/the-xxxi-olympic-games-5771/men/decathlon/1500-metres/points).

Animations are best run on your local server rather than from the
cloud where the experience will be quite jarring.
